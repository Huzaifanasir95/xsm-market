# XSM Market - Connection Pool Fix

## ðŸ”§ Problem Fixed

**Issue:** `Error: Can't add new command when connection is in closed state`

**Root Cause:** The server was using a single MySQL connection that would close/timeout, causing subsequent requests to fail.

## âœ… Solution Applied

**Fixed:** Implemented MySQL connection pooling with proper connection management.

### Key Changes:

1. **Connection Pool:** Replaced single connection with a connection pool
2. **Proper Release:** Each request gets a fresh connection and releases it
3. **Error Handling:** Better error handling for connection failures
4. **Timeout Settings:** Added proper timeout and reconnection settings

### New Connection Configuration:
```javascript
const dbConfig = {
  host: process.env.DB_HOST || 'localhost',
  user: process.env.DB_USER,
  password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD,
  database: process.env.DB_NAME,
  port: process.env.DB_PORT || 3306,
  waitForConnections: true,
  connectionLimit: 10,
  queueLimit: 0,
  acquireTimeout: 60000,
  timeout: 60000,
  reconnect: true
};
```

### Request Pattern:
```javascript
app.get('/api/ads', async (req, res) => {
  let connection;
  try {
    connection = await pool.getConnection();
    const [rows] = await connection.execute('SELECT ...');
    res.json(result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed' });
  } finally {
    if (connection) connection.release(); // Always release!
  }
});
```

## ðŸš€ Deployment

The updated `xsm-final-clean.zip` includes:
- âœ… Fixed server.js with connection pooling
- âœ… Updated deployment instructions
- âœ… Database cleaning functionality
- âœ… Production-ready configuration

## ðŸ“‹ Updated Deployment Steps

1. Upload new ZIP to Hostinger
2. Extract to `public_html/`
3. `cd public_html/api && npm install`
4. `pm2 stop xsm-api || true` (stop old version)
5. `pm2 delete xsm-api || true` (remove old version)
6. `npm run clean-db` (clean database)
7. `pm2 start server.js --name xsm-api` (start new version)
8. `pm2 logs xsm-api` (check logs)

## ðŸŽ¯ Result

- âœ… No more connection errors
- âœ… Handles multiple concurrent requests
- âœ… Automatic connection recovery
- âœ… Clean database start
- âœ… Production-stable
